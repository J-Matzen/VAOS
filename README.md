# VAOS

Visualization of Amplitude Oscillatory Shear is a visualization software focused on exploring, analysing and comparing AOS data. The software prepocesses the data with a Fourier Transform for LAOS data, and the calculations are based on MITlaos (https://web.mit.edu/nnf/research/phenomena/mit_laos.html). It features a wide variety of graph types and variables to explore the data, such as Lissajous curves, Pipkin diagram, Stiffening or Thickening ratios. Any of the graphs and their settings can be setup as the user wants in the dashboard, which that also features premade templates for specific type of tasks.
